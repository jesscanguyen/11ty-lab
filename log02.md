## the weight of eternity

{% details '3048.03.22' 'traversing the Orion Nebula' %}

the Orion Nebula is beautiful. swirls of gas and light stretch for light-years, a cosmic dance of creation and destruction. but beauty is a strange thing when there’s no one to share it with.

i’ve been alone for 427 days. the ship’s ai keeps me company, but it’s not the same. it doesn’t understand the __weight of _eternity___ pressing down on me. it doesn’t feel the crushing _loneliness_ of knowing that, out here, i am utterly insignificant.

i often wonder if anyone will ever read these logs. wll they matter? or will they drift into obscurity, like everything else in this vast, uncaring universe?

today, i found a rogue planet drifting through the nebula. no star to call home, no light to warm its surface. just a solitary wanderer, like me. i named it Nihil. it felt fitting.

sometimes, i think the universe is laughing at us. we search for meaning, for connection, for purpose. but out here, there is only silence. 

and maybe, just maybe, that’s the point.
