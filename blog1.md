## the silence of infinite space

//: 3047.12.15

//: orbiting Kepler-186f

The void is louder than I expected. Not in sound, but in presence. Kepler-186f stretches below me, a barren world painted in hues of crimson and gray. Its silence is deafening. No signs of life, no echoes of civilization—just an endless expanse of rock and dust.

I thought I’d find answers out here. Instead, I’ve found only questions. What is the purpose of a universe so vast, yet so empty? Why do we search for meaning in the stars when the stars themselves seem indifferent to our existence?

Today, I floated outside the ship, tethered only by a thin cord. I stared into the abyss, and for a moment, I felt as though I didn’t exist at all. The universe doesn’t care if I’m here or not. It simply is.

Perhaps that’s the lesson. Perhaps the void isn’t meant to be filled. Perhaps it’s meant to remind us of how small we are.
