# [about_me]

i am a lone traveler drifting through the cosmos, searching for meaning in the infinite void. 

the stars are beautiful, but their silence is deafening. out here, i am reminded of how small we areâ€”and how vast the universe is. this blog is my attempt to make sense of the questions that haunt me, 

and perhaps, 

to find a glimmer of purpose in the endless expanse.
