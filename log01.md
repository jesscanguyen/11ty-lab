# [log_01]

## the silence of infinite space

{% details '3047.12.15' 'orbiting Kepler-186f' %}

the void is louder than i expected. not in sound, but in presence. Kepler-186f stretches below me, a barren world painted in hues of crimson and gray. its silence is deafening. no signs of life, no echoes of civilization—just an endless expanse of rock and dust.

i thought i’d find answers out here. instead, i’ve found only questions. what is the purpose of a universe so vast, yet so empty? why do we search for meaning in the stars when the stars themselves seem indifferent to our existence?

today, i floated outside the ship, tethered only by a thin cord. i stared into the abyss, and for a moment, i felt as though i didn’t exist at all. __the universe doesn’t care if i’m here or not.__ it simply _is._

perhaps that’s the lesson. perhaps the void isn’t meant to be filled. perhaps it’s meant to remind us of how small we are.
